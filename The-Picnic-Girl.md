THE PICNIC GIRL
This section in the newspaper starts off with a seemingly normal story about a picnic girl who goes out for a picnic. It soon transitions into talking about the hardships that The Picnic Girl has to go through when she has picnics, such as mixing the salad, not screaming when spiders crawl on her, and having her picnic spoiled by rain. What follows this brief introduction is what I found weird about this article. It abruptly changes themes into talking about how the rain that ruined her frock has given her rheumatism. It talks about how The Picnic Girl has now been bed ridden for weeks and how all parts of her body have been affected by her rheumatism. The article goes on to say that she was having trouble breathing and then yet another twist happened, she brought up Dr. Williams’ pink pills.
What I first thought was a cheery short story quickly transitioned to a rather depressing and bleak drama, which I felt was not too weird in terms of storytelling, but I was caught by surprise when the sad story then transitioned again into an advertisement. The second to last paragraph talked about how Mrs. Moorecroft, The Picnic Girl, needed new blood to cure her rheumatism and that Dr. Williams’ pink pills were the cure. (and apparently made her new blood) The advertisement continued and said that these special pink pills also cured a long list of many more diseases and that people should be careful to not mistakenly buy fake substitutes of Dr. Williams’ pill.
I found this article interesting because it reminded me of television commercials of today that start off with scenes that may catch your attention and then suddenly become advertisements once your attention has been grabbed. Upon further research I found that the official name for the pills was “Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People” which reminded me even more of current world advertisements that use alliteration and catchy phrases to gain more publicity. Researching this article also brought the usage and sale of “patent pills”, commercial products advertised (usually heavily) as over-the-counter medicines, without regard to their effectiveness (also known as “nostrums”), to my attention.
